        <li>What is React? What are its features</li> React was created by Jordane Walke , a software engineer at facebook in the year 2011 and it was deployed first at the facebook newsfeed and later it was used in facebook and instagram. React is a open source front end js library . It follows the component based approach for building reusable  UI components speacially for single page application
        and it is used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application.
        <ul>
            <li>Virual Dom</li>
            <li>One Way Data Binding</li>
            <li>Reusable Component</li>
            <li>JSX(Javascript Syntex Extention)</li>
            <li>Performance</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Explain Virtual DOM</li>DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM, which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time., whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time. Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM. So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom. Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom. this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.
        <li>Explain Diffing Algorithm</li>
        <li>REact, Angular or Veu</li>
        <li>LIbray or framework</li>
        Library is a set of reusable functions used by computer programme and framework is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of a project , code calls the library but in framework , framework calls the code. in libray we can control the data flow by methods but in framework we dont have any control of the data flow framework decides how the dat awill flow that is nothing but frameworks callls the code. and in perfornmance wise react is having higher performance over angular and veu and community support and also react is having the easy learning curve and react is having SPA(Single page application) .
         <li>Class vs func</li> 
         <ul>
             <li>Class Component uses the Lifecycle methods where as in functional component have HOOKs</li>
             <li>Functional component are also called stateless component while class component is called statefull component and there is no render function while in functional there is return  </li>
             <li>functional component accepts props as argument but props and state can be accepted in class components</li>
             <li>Functinal Componenrs are easty to read as they have less code but the class components have complex code structure and hard to write.</li>
             <li>In class component we uses the "this " keyword but in functional we dont need the keyword</li>
         </ul>
         <li>Stateless vs Statefull</li> Stateless component does not hold or manage state While statefu;ll component can hold or manage state, Stateless component are easy to understand but the statefull component it is complex as compared to the stateless components. Stateless component does not work with react lifecycles but whreas statefull work with lifecycle methods. Stateless can not be reused while can be used in case of statefull component.Stateless compnent is also known as functional component. Statefull is known as class component
         <li>What are the different phases of React components lifecycle?</li> In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are:
         1.	Initial Phase
         2.	Mounting Phase
         3.	Updating Phase
         4.	Unmounting Phase
         Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the particular phase

             <li>SPA vs MPA</li>
             <ul>
                 <li>In terms of performance SPA not need the reloading so giving higher performance and responsiveness while SPA is slow and performance is affected by reloading. </li>
                 <li>Acc to coding-wise SPA has reusable code for single page application while MPA need coding from scratch hence no place for reusability</li>
                 <li>Acc to maintenance SPA is having fast and easy maintenance while in MPA the mainetenance need to be done for each page.</li>
                 <li>Acc to SEO the SPA is having limited optimization while MPA has several optimization</li>
                 <li>Acc to user experience the SPA is very smooth and friendly while in MPA has worse user experience</li>
                 <li>No loading time is required in SPA while it takes ages if the connection is slow.</li>
                 <li>Acc to security we have to secure the endpoint while the MPA need each page to be secured saparately </li>
             </ul>
             <li>State vs Props</li>
             <ul>
                 <li>Props are read-only.	State changes can be asynchronous.</li>
                 <li>Props are immutable.	State is mutable.</li>
                 <li>Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.	State holds information about the components.</li>
                 <li>Props can be accessed by the child component.	State cannot be accessed by child components.</li>
                 <li>Props are used to communicate between components.	States can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component.</li>
                 <li>Stateless component can have Props.	Stateless components cannot have State.</li>
                 <li>Props make components reusable.	State cannot make components reusable.</li>
                 <li>Props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.	The State is internal and controlled by the React Component itself.</li>
             </ul>
             <li>Props Drilling and state uplifting</li>
             Prop drilling is basically a situation when the same data is being sent at almost every level due to requirements in the final level. 
             <br><br>
             every component in React has its own state. Because of this sometimes data can be redundant and inconsistent. So, by Lifting up the state we make the state of the parent component as a single source of truth and pass the data of the parent in its children.
